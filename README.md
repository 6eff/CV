## Victor Vasiliev

Always curious about new things, new ways os solving old problems. Challenging myself and others around me on believes otherwise considered right and legit. Truly believe that simple solutions are best solutions to every problem.
For last couple of years I was managing finance function within companies and as an external consultant. Now I embarked a developer boat to sail ever-changing see of information technology.
I'd like to join a team of like-minded individuals, a company that values result over the process, that truly believes that company results are results of each person working under same roof and that exceptional products start with exceptional work place. I'd like to join a team for which X-programming values are not just words from some fancy new technique.

## Skills
#### Team player
I have experience of being a team member starting from a junior role ending up managing several teams on different assignments. I've managed teams of 2 to departments of 30 people.

#### Project management
Working as a consultant (one of Big 4 public accountancy companies) I was using best practices and PMI methodologies to manage projects, which involved managing project resources, client expectations and quality of deliverables. Skills I possess allowed me finish one of my corporate reporting projects just with one month ahead of schedule

#### Communication Skills
My experience comprises working both from within companies and outside them, together with working in multicultural environments. I've worked in consultancy in Moldova, Romania, Russia. And with a wide breadth of stakeholders.

#### Analytical skills
Working as a consultant involves a lot of analysis and it requires not only debugging client's business processes but also advising on ways to make them more effective. That experience helped a lot when I've started coding. It just becomes your second nature of feeling what could be wrong or that something is too complicated to be effective and efficient.

#### Web development
Graduating [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) is what really allows me add web dev to my skills. I can distinguish code that was written using TDD from one that wasn't, I can tell why you need refactoring. I can advocate use of agile development and X-programming values and persuade to use those, because benefits are great. I know that my code needs to be SOLID in order to work and not being scraped in two weeks. I understand why designing my app on RESTful architecture will make it fast, reliable and scalable. I know what I'd use on each of layers of three tear architecture and what's happening behind.
There are couple of projects where I've tried to learn those skills and implement them
* [Devine](https://github.com/SocialList/devine) trying to make Github sociable
* [BnB](https://github.com/lukecartledge/MakersBnB) cloning a well known bed and breakfast searching app
* [Chitter](https://github.com/6eff/chitter-challenge) microblogging
* [Game of - RPSSL](https://github.com/6eff/rps-challenge)

#### Perseverance
Making a drastic change from finance professional to a web developer and finishing a 12 weeks demanding bootcamp required a lot of perseverance.
